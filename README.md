# TCP-based-Chat-Client

#This is a TCP based Chat client-server program written in python for my project at BTH univ.
#To run the program you have to first clone the repo in your desired folder.
#Then initiate the server program by running the command "./chatserver 127.0.0.1:5000"
#Which is the host IP and Host Port number.
# The server then waits for a connection from a client

#To initiate the client program. Open another terminal and run the commant 
#"./chatclient 127.0.0.1:5000 *YOUR DESRIED NICKNAME* "
#This initiates a connection between the client and server. 
#You can add more client connection by running the same command in different terminals and changing the NICK ID.
